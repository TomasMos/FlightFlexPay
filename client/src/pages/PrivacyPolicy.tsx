            <p className="mb-4">
              We will ordinarily provide you with an explanation as to why we are collecting your personal information at the time 
              that we collect it. Sometimes, we are required by law to collect your personal information, for example, to comply with 
              our legislative or legal obligations. While there may be some circumstances where it will be possible for you to interact 
              with us on an anonymous basis or using an alias, these are rare and we will generally need to know who you are in order to 
              comply with our legal obligations and to assist you.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so, which will depend on the reasons for which 
              we have collected and need to use your personal data.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In most cases, we will need to process your personal data so that we can enter into our contract and fulfil the provision 
              or delivery of goods or services to you.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is being processed. To determine 
              the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which 
              we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
