# FlightPay - Flight Booking with Payment Plans

## Overview
FlightPay is a modern flight booking application that allows users to search for flights and book them with flexible payment plans. The application enables customers to pay just 20% upfront and spread the remaining amount over installments, making travel more accessible.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
This is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client, server, and shared code are organized in a single repository for easier development and deployment
- **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript support across the entire stack for better type safety and developer experience
- **Modern React Stack**: Uses React 18 with hooks, React Query for state management, and Wouter for routing
- **Express.js Backend**: Lightweight and flexible Node.js backend framework
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle**: Robust database with modern TypeScript ORM for type-safe database operations

## Data Flow

### Complete Customer Journey (According to Specification)
1. **Flight Search**: Every search is saved to `flight_searches` table with session tracking
2. **Passenger Details**: Contact and passenger information saved as `leads` with `lead_attempts`
3. **Payment Processing**: Successful payment converts lead to registered `users`
4. **Booking Creation**: Complete booking with flight data, payment plan, and installments created
5. **Lead Conversion**: Anonymous leads become registered users upon successful payment

### Flight Search Flow
1. User types in origin/destination with real-time autocomplete from Amadeus Airport API
2. System provides airport and city suggestions with IATA codes
3. Frontend validates input using Zod schema and sends IATA codes for search
4. **Database Tracking**: Flight search saved to database with session ID for anonymous tracking
5. Backend calls Amadeus Flight Offers API for flight data
6. Payment plan eligibility calculated for each flight
7. Enhanced flight data returned with payment plan information

### Lead Generation & Booking Flow
1. User selects flight and enters passenger details
2. **Lead Creation**: Contact and passenger data saved as lead with lead attempt record
3. User selects payment plan and processes payment
4. **Conversion**: Successful payment creates user account from lead data
5. **Complete Booking**: Flight, payment plan, installments, and booking records created
6. **Lead Status Update**: Lead marked as "converted" upon successful booking

### External Service Integration

## External Dependencies

### Major Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM and query builder
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **zod**: Runtime type validation
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type system for JavaScript
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing tool
- **ESBuild**: JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both Vite dev server and Express backend
- **Production Build**: 
  - Frontend: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
  - Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations managed via `npm run db:push`

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment setting (development/production)
- **Amadeus API**: Client ID and secret for flight data

### Hosting Considerations
- **Static Assets**: Frontend builds to standard web-servable directory
- **API Server**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files
- **Database**: Compatible with any PostgreSQL provider
- **Session Storage**: Uses connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

The application is designed for deployment on platforms like Replit, Vercel, or traditional hosting providers with Node.js and PostgreSQL support.
