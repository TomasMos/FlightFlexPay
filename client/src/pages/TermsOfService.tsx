            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Booking Process</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When you make a booking through Splickets, you are entering into a contract directly with the 
              Travel Provider. Splickets facilitates the booking and payment process but is not a party to 
              the travel contract.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Payment Plans</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Splickets offers flexible payment plans that allow you to pay for your travel in instalments:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>You must pay an initial deposit to secure your booking</li>
              <li>Remaining payments are spread over weekly or bi-weekly instalments</li>
              <li>All payments must be completed before your departure date</li>
              <li>Payment plans are subject to approval and availability</li>
              <li>Failure to make payments may result in cancellation of your booking</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3.3 Price Lock</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When you book through Splickets and pay your deposit, we lock in the price at the time of booking. 
              This means the price you pay will not increase, even if the Travel Provider's prices change.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">4. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Cancellation and refund policies are determined by the Travel Provider, not by Splickets. 
              When you cancel a booking:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Refund eligibility depends on the Travel Provider's terms and conditions</li>
              <li>Any refunds will be processed according to the Travel Provider's policy</li>
              <li>Splickets may charge an administration fee for processing cancellations</li>
              <li>If you have made partial payments, refunds will be calculated based on the Travel Provider's 
              cancellation policy</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We recommend reviewing the Travel Provider's terms before making a booking.
